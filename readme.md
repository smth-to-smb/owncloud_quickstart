# Quickstart for Installing and Using Owncloud

## Introduction

owncloud is a cloud collaboration platform which can be deployed on your server facilities. The main purpose of using ownCloud is to share files between colleagues.

This Quickstart explains how to deploy Owncloud on a server and use it.

> All information from this Quickstart is available on [ownCloud Documentation](https://doc.owncloud.com/) page.

After you have read this document, you will learn how to:

- install ownCloud on your server,
- enable users to connect to the installed ownCloud instance,
- manage users accounts on the installed instance.

As a user, you will learn how to connect to ownCloud using desktop and mobile clients.

## Installing ownCloud server

You can install ownCloud either using a Docker image or manually.

### System and software requirements

Before installation, verify system and software requirements on [Software requirements](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.0/admin_manual/installation/system_requirements.html) page.

### Docker installation

Download a Docker image from the [official ownCloud Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/owncloud/server/) page.

Prepare separate Docker containers for MariaDB/MySQL and Redis, as well as data volume in the host filesystem. The configuration of ownCloud:

- exposes port 8080, allowing for HTTP connections,

- mounts the data and MariaDB/MySQL data directories on the host for persistent storage.

Create a new project directory and download `docker-compose.yml` from [the ownCloud Docker GitHub repository](https://github.com/owncloud-docker/server.git).

Create `.env` file in the project directory and fill it with following settings:


| Setting name | Description | Example |
| ------------ |:-----------:| -------:|
| `OWNCLOUD_VERSION`| The ownCloud version | `latest` |
| `OWNCLOUD_DOMAIN`| The ownCloud domain | `localhost` |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME`| The admin username | `admin` |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD`| The admin userâ€™s password | `admin` |
| `HTTP_PORT`| The HTTP port to bind to | `8080` |


Start the container. You can find instructions for plain docker in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/owncloud-docker/server#launch-with-plain-docker).

Run `docker-compose ps` command to check whether all containers have successfully started. 

Open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/). Here you can find a login screen.

Use admin credentials from `.env` file to log into ownCloud.

Find more details on installation and managing ownCloud docker containers at [Installation on a Local Machine](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/10.1/admin_manual/installation/docker/#installation-on-a-local-machine) chapter.

### Manual installation

Download the latest archive with ownCloud server from [ownCloud Download Page](https://owncloud.org/install). You can verify MD5 or SHA256 sum to guarantee successful downloading.

> You can read an installation example on [Install ownCloud on Ubuntu 18.04](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/10.1/admin_manual/installation/ubuntu_18_04.html) page.

Extract the archive contents into a single ownCloud directory.

Copy ownCloud directory to its final destination. In case of Apache HTTP server it can be Apache document root. For other web servers it should be a folder outside the document root.

Configure the web server. Read more about it at [Configure the Web Server](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/10.1/admin_manual/installation/manual_installation.html#configure-the-web-server) chapter.

If you run Apache under Ubuntu, you can enable SSL with following commands:

```
a2enmod ssl
a2ensite default-ssl
service apache2 reload
```

Enable Apache Prefork. You can read more on [Apache Prefork](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/prefork.html) page.

Run either the graphical or command line installation wizard. Refer to:

- [The Installation Wizard](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/10.1/admin_manual/installation/installation_wizard.html) for GUI installation, or
- [Command Line Installation](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/10.1/admin_manual/installation/command_line_installation.html) page to run a CLI version.
